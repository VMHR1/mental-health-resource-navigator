# Cloudflare Pages redirects and rewrites
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/

# Note: This is a multi-page app (index.html, program.html, submit.html, admin.html)
# SPA routing redirect is not needed. If you add client-side routing later, use:
# /program/:id    /program.html?id=:id    200

# Ensure admin.html is served correctly (not redirected)
/admin.html    /admin.html    200

# Example: Redirect old URLs (if you have any)
# /old-path    /new-path    301

# Example: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Cloudflare does this automatically, but you can be explicit)
# http://example.com/*    https://example.com/:splat    301
